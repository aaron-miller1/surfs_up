### Summary

The data shows that the average temperatures through the hottest and coldest months of the year never fall below 70 degrees. There are days in the winter that fall into the 60s but this is not enough to deter a year round Surf/Ice cream shop to not open based on profitability. The shop should do well through all months of the year. 

Some other queries to consider performing are average rain fall during these months and even for the entire year as neither surfing or ice cream are very popular during a rainy day which could change whether or not you would consider a year round opening for this shop. A query combining both temperature and rainfall could also benefit the decision as Hawaii has a tropical climate so even though it may be raining it could still be in the upper 70s and be an ideal time to grab ice cream.
